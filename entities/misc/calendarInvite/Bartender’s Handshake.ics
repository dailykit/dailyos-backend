DESCRIPTION:<p>I get asked many questions about my job - including what bar
	tenders  drink when they go out. We keep it simple. Give us a good beer an
	d  strong shot and we're happy. We call it a Bartender's Handshake in the 
	 industry - not to be confused with the cocktail drink that is also  calle
	d the Bartender's Handshake.But the two couldn't be more different.  In th
	is experience\, we'll start by cheering with your favorite beer and  shot 
	before making the cocktail version\, a delicious daiquiri on ice.</p>
